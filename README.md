# The King's Bird ASL 1.0.0
A LiveSplit autosplitter for [The King's Bird](http://serenityforge.com/games/thekingsbird).

## Features
There are many options so you can customize the automatic splits to your preference:
 * Start timer
   * Starts when you restart your save file
 * Game time
   * Removes load times when comparing to game time
 * Hubs, Levels, Shrines, Dreams
   * You choose where it splits, before or after!
 * Fallen Kingdom
   * The long one, and the small parts afterward
 * Boss fight
   * Again, you can split before and after
 * End of the game
   * Obviously. Note: Doesn't split until fadeout, 5 seconds too late (I'm working on it)

## How to install
